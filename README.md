This website hosts all of the code for [my website](https://manan-chopra.com).

## Motivation
I created this website at first to simply showcase my projects and publications completed during and after my M.S. at UC San Diego in Bioinformatics. I now also plan to add some less professionally focused pages, including some media reviews (movies, books, TV shows).

## Tech Stack
The website was hand-coded by myself using React and Node.js . Deployed with Vercel.
