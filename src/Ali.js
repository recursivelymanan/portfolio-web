            On this page is something I've put together representing the journey
            our relationship took until this day. It's kind of a poem and kind
            of rambling, but I hope you enjoy it.

        stop trying so hard to find a relationship. focus on your schoolwork and
        career, reach out to some labs, get a response! interview, accept the
        position, show up. enjoy your work, start to make friends.

      <p class="title">step 3</p>
      <p class="body">
        be at lab a few weeks later when she officially starts. work up the
        courage to talk to her a little, make her laugh, love her smile, and
        remember her name this time.
      </p>
      <p class="title">step 4</p>
      <p class="body">
        offer your help to her around lab, and hope you aren’t being too obvious
        (you probably are). daydream about how amazing it would be dating her.

        talk about how you are going to play solitaire even though your doctor

        this is your first long conversation with her, and you never want it to
        end.

      <p class="title">step 5</p>
      <p class="body">
        get to know her. become friends, hang out around lab talking shit about
        certain people and just enjoy her company. stop dreaming about the
        possibility of dating and just be her friend, because it doesn’t seem

        fall into a comfortable friendship, successfully ignore (for the most
        part) your feelings because you don’t want to jeopardize a good friend.
        form a little trio with her and her roommate grace, the three of you
        will become great friends.

        on august 10 2022, go to flicks, the bar in hillcrest, with some of your
        roommates, grace, and her. dance and drink, she and grace will step away
        together. watch her come back to the group, look you in the eyes, and
        kiss you. the kiss will feel similar to what remy in ratitoullie must've
        felt when he ate grape and cheese at the same time. struggle to wipe the
        stupid grin off of your face for the rest of the night.

        everything is different now. communicate clearly with her for the next
        few weeks, you will both need time to organize your feelings. decide to

        i thought it would be a cute way to show the little things that shaped
        how i felt about you and how we would begin dating. ironically, it
        doesn't really cover much of the year we actually dated.

        i didn't fall in love with you all at once after a great night, i didn't
        have an epiphany after seeing you on some day. my love for you grew
        slowly and steadily day by day, and all of a sudden i was madly in love.
